# Default Font Registry Key for Windows 11


This file is the default registry key of **Windows 11/10**. Like me, lot's of people faced and still facing the issue by changing default fonts of Windows. Tried a lots of way to recover the default font but somehow didn't workd propely.

This is totally a fresh and brand new registry key backed up from **Windows 11**. You can use this registry key to recover default fonts of your **Windows 10/11**.
